😼 Tech enthusiast by day, cozy chaos gremlin by night.  
☕ Thrives on caffeine, memes, and mysterious vibes.  
💻 Currently learning to code (but still hissing at bugs).  
🌙 Loves the moon, lo-fi beats, and pretending life is a Studio Ghibli movie.  
🐱 Not actually a cat, despite strong feline energy.
